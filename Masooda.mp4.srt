2
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,916
Hey, get up!

3
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,541
Wake up!
Faisal!

4
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,416
Get up.

5
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,541
Let’s go.

6
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,708
Where is your bag?

7
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,208
I am not going.

8
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,958
But you said you will come along.

9
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,208
I will.
But later.

10
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,833
I won’t go without you.

11
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,875
-Listen to me, Faisal!
-No, no.

12
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,250
I am not going without you.

13
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,041
What about Meer Bhai?

14
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,791
You don’t have to worry about Meer Bhai.

15
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,333
Trust me.

16
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,208
Do you know what will happen to you
if you stay here?

17
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,416
What about the horses?

18
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,500
It’s not safe
to stay here any longer

19
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:43,916
Let’s go.

20
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,041
My legs hurt,
slow down

21
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,416
Don’t talk.

22
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,708
What happened?

23
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,833
The sounds we heard so far fell silent.

24
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,666
Frogs and insects-

25
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,416
They’ve gone silent

26
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,166
Run away, Faisal.

27
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,375
Run!

28
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,500
Uncle Meer! Uncle Meer!

29
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,083
Nargis?

30
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,500
She caught hold of uncles
and took them away.

31
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,000
-Where did she take them?
-To the old bungalow.

32
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,125
Go home immediately.

33
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,833
No, uncle.
I will go with you.

34
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:29,833
Calm down, Javed!

35
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,250
Javed! Calm down!

36
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,375
Javed, control yourself.

37
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,916
Uncle Meer!

38
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,083
Greetings, sir.

39
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,041
Tell me.

40
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,333
The neighbours had complained
of some stench to the municipality.

41
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,750
As it stopped stinking,
no one followed it up.

42
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,541
But last night, there seemed to have been
unbearable stench.

43
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,125
Howling and screaming is common
from that house.

44
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,958
Others didn’t interfere as they thought
it was a family issue.

45
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,958
They said they saw the man beat his wife
with a slipper two weeks ago.

46
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,541
But she took the beating in silence.

47
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,833
The kind of people
that exist in the world!

48
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,041
It breaks my heart
to hear such things.

49
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,583
What I feel is…

50
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,000
Look! Shut up and say it in two words.

51
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,625
I will listen to your heart
and your stupid thoughts later.

52
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,833
A decomposed female corpse is found
tied to a tree, sir.

53
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,458
It is swollen beyond recognition.

54
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,125
I think they starved her for two-three days
and stabbed her repeatedly.

55
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,708
But what I feel is those blood stains…

56
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,208
-Stop it!
-Sorry, sir.

57
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,291
Sir, you better mask your face.

58
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,916
Not necessary.
My stomach’s empty.

59
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,083
Sir!

60
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,791
Sir! What happened, sir?

61
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,541
Give me the cloth.

62
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:23,916
Get me one more.

63
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,375
I feel I might die

64
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,541
I know this is your house as well.

65
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,416
But you have gone too far.

66
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,375
Forgive me.
I have no other way.

67
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,750
I cannot spare you today.

68
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,041
Forgive me.

69
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,125
I am sorry.

70
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,041
No, Gopi.
No, please.

71
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,833
Hey, it’s dead.
Don’t you want to see?

72
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,333
Not at all!

73
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,958
Apparently, Leonardo da vinci…

74
00:12:56,083 --> 00:13:01,250
waited outside of hospitals for hours to cut
open corpse and see what’s inside

75
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,958
Great job he did.

76
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,291
But I know how scared
you were to kill a tiny rat.

77
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,291
A living rat might scare me.

78
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,708
What can a dead rat do, Nazia?

79
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,875
-Take a look.
-No, Gopi!

80
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,416
Please, throw it out.

81
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,875
My mother would’ve killed me
if the milk spilled over.

82
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,833
-What happened?
-There is one more over there.

83
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,000
How many more?

84
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,708
You’re gobbling up the peanuts well,
but what about the money you owe.

85
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,875
I mean, unless you pay at least half,

86
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,916
boss told me not to give you groceries.

87
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,708
I will pay the whole thing in three days.

88
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you have money for these?

89
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,708
Show me?

90
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,708
Fine. These are sufficient

91
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,291
Why do they show such bad news
first thing in the morning?

92
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,541
Don’t we have enough headaches?

93
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,291
Why do you watch stuff like that?

94
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,208
There are educational channels, right?

95
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,833
You don’t go to school anyway.

96
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,375
Why don’t you learn something from them?

97
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,125
You owe three thousand rupees in total.

98
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,791
I will give you in three days.

99
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,083
-What do you want, madam?
-Give me these items.

100
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,708
Madam, Neelam!

101
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,041
Mr Yashpal!

102
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,500
How are you?
How is your health?

103
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:05,166
I’m unable to catch you at your flat
how many ever times I come

104
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,208
Including this month,
you owe me three months’ rent.

105
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,125
There was a delay in the money
I was expecting.

106
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,833
That’s why I couldn’t pay you.

107
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,333
As soon as I get it,
I will first pay you.

108
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,166
Don’t the railways pay salaries?

109
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,458
-It’s school…
-Yes, yes.

110
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,291
Doesn’t the school pay you salary?

111
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,041
I don’t intend to trouble you.

112
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,375
When my wife was sick,
you helped us a lot.

113
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,291
But I need money too.

114
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,291
Please do it at the earliest.

115
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,833
Okay. See you.

116
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,250
We better close the gaps with cement.

117
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,166
I think that’s how the rats enter.

118
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,416
Yes. I just spoke to Mr Yashpal.

119
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,708
By the way
what happened to your promotion?

120
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,833
Promising.
But can’t say right now.

121
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,916
Hard work can get you anything, Gopi.

122
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,500
My dad used to say…

123
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:58,000
Our future depends on what we do today.

124
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,500
Mom, your dad didn’t say that.
It’s Gandhi who said that

125
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,458
Shut up.

126
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,166
Hey, what’s up, Rat killer?

127
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,291
-Hi, Nazia!
-Hi!

128
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,208
Aunty, rent!

129
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:12,958
I will give you in three days.

130
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,541
-No, my dad said..
-I already spoke to your dad.

131
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,291
Oh is it, okay.

132
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,000
Hey, I forgot to tell you.

133
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,166
From today I work night shifts.

134
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,916
-Okay, I will make a move.
-Okay.

135
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,625
-Bye, Gopi.
-Bye, Nazia.

136
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,833
-Bye, Yuvaraj.
-Bye.

137
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,291
-Bye, Nazia.
-Bye.

138
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,833
Mom!

139
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,916
-I don’t want to go to college today.
-Why?

140
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,791
Did we hear three whistles?

141
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,625
Mom, I have a stomach ache.

142
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,500
Oh?
What happened?

143
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,333
I am not lying.

144
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,000
My daughter is so hard working.

145
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,375
She will go to college
in spite of a stomach ache.

146
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,541
-Mom!
-Enough of your acting. Get ready.

147
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,333
This is the third time this month.

148
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,083
Mom, please.

149
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,291
Mom!

150
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,291
Aunty!

151
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:13,958
Aunty!

152
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,083
Gopi! Come home in the evening.

153
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,000
-I am making fish fry.
-Okay.

154
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,041
I didn’t tell you
because Yuvaraj was there.

155
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,958
He will think we eat fish fry
though we don’t pay rent in time.

156
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,625
Okay? Bye.

157
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,208
-Where are you off to?
-Oh my!

158
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,708
-You seem to be in a great hurry?
-Yes.

159
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,208
Uh… no.

160
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,666
-Are you giving it wholeheartedly?
-Yes.

161
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,875
-Hundred rupees.
-Hundred?

162
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,875
Yes. I am going to Ajmer sharif.

163
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,833
I will pray for you.

164
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,333
-Are you giving it wholeheartedly?
-Yes.

165
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,791
God bless you.

166
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,416
Fortune will knock at your door soon.

167
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,583
Is Mini not here?

168
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,083
-Hi!
-Hi!

169
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,000
No problem. Okay.

170
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,875
Gopi! Gopi!

171
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,416
Listen!

172
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,041
If you get a chance to invite
five famous actors to dinner,

173
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,833
…whether they are dead or alive.

174
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,875
Where is Mini?
Is she on leave today?

175
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,541
Forget her.
Tell me this.

176
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,166
If you get a chance to invite
five famous actors to dinner,

177
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,708
Sudhakar, I am not at all interested
in these games.

178
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,416
What is your problem?
What will you do when you see her?

179
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,708
You call me timid, don’t you?

180
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,583
Wait! I will definitely ask her out today.

181
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,541
How many dates do you need?

182
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,291
We went to some ten movies
and twenty dinners together.

183
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,708
You don’t call it a date
if the entire office goes together.

184
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,666
I will ask her if she will come
on a date with me alone or not.

185
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,708
-I see.
-Do you know what Gandhi said?

186
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,708
There is no success unless you try.

187
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,375
-Ask her out then.
-I will!

188
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,333
-I will definitely ask.
-She is right behind you.

189
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,416
My foot!

190
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,208
Hi!

191
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,625
It’s Okra curry today.

192
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,750
Okay.

193
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,250
Okay.

194
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,333
How well you spoke, Gopi?

195
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,125
Don’t you get nervous
when you do that?

196
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,083
I should have spoken better.

197
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,458
You are not able to convey birthday wishes.

198
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,875
How can you call her on date?

199
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,916
-What made me say that?
-Tell me now.

200
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,708
If you get a chance to invite
five famous actors to dinner,

201
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,791
…whether they are dead or alive.

202
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,500
Whom would you invite? And why?

203
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,208
-I’ll invite no one.
-Why?

204
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,083
I don’t think any of my favourite actors
would dine with me.

205
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,958
Despite knowing that I don’t want
to invite them, get rejected and feel hurt.

206
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,250
How ridiculous.

207
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,666
Do you know whom I would invite?

208
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,875
Aishwarya Rai, Katrina Kaif,

209
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,125
Tamannaah Bhatia,
and Ileana D’Cruz…

210
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,166
because I think they are super hot, man.

211
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,958
And also Divya Bharti.

212
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:33,916
What?

213
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,083
What?

214
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,291
Do you call Divya Bharati?

215
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,125
Of course. I am big fan of her.

216
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:43,708
I want to know her death of cause.

217
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,583
What?

218
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:51,333
You want to call a dead person to your
happy party and ask her how she died?

219
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,541
Yes!

220
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,791
Dead people would like to come back
and tell us how they died and what happened.

221
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,375
Sudhakar!

222
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,000
I never met someone as wise as you!
-I know!

223
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,416
I have also not come across anyone
as brave as you, Gopi.

224
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,541
She must have thought
I was a foodaholic.

225
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,291
Idea!

226
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,708
Has she cut the cake?

227
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,791
She has and they all ate it too.

228
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,916
Go, give her the card.

229
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,208
There are people around her.

230
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,083
There are always people around her.
Go.

231
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,458
Go on!

232
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,666
Mini!

233
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,208
-Happy Birthday.
-Thanks.

234
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,208
-Hey, Mini, wish you a happy birthday.
-Thank you. Thanks.

235
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,458
-Happy Birthday…
-Thank you!

236
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,583
Where is the party?

237
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,583
Can you guess how many Earths
can fit into the Sun?

238
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,625
-Twenty?
-No.

239
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,916
-Hundred?
-No.

240
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,041
Any other guesses?

241
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,583
Okay.

242
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,375
1.3 million Earths can fit into the Sun.

243
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,500
Yes, Pooja?

244
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,083
Teacher, can I invite everyone
to my birthday party?

245
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,583
Absolutely unrelated topic!

246
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,583
But… important…

247
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,208
So, please go ahead.

248
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,750
Okay.
Tomorrow we will have a test.

249
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,625
Please come prepared, okay?

250
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,250
[all]: Okay, teacher!

251
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,208
Ma’am!

252
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,791
-Ma’am!
-Teacher!

253
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,541
Tell me, Neelam.

254
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,875
Did they give you salary?

255
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,958
What salary?

256
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,458
They paid up to Class VII staff.

257
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,458
My sister is helping me
and so I am able to manage.

258
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,000
What about you?

259
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,208
I don’t really know.

260
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,625
It would be nice if they pay soon.

261
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,750
Nazia’s painting competition
is getting close.

262
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,875
Why don’t you speak to the Principal?

263
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,458
Okay?

264
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,083
Good morning, ma’am!

265
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,958
Do you think she will complain
to the manager?

266
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,208
Why would she complain
about a greeting card?

267
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,000
Anyway, she likes you.
Don’t worry.

268
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,541
I wrote something else
besides birthday wishes.

269
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,708
Oh, no!
What did you write?

270
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,000
I wrote ’You look beautiful today.

271
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,000
You have a fine dressing sense.’

272
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,583
-And?
-That’s all.

273
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,375
That’s all?

274
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,750
Do you know what I wrote
in the greeting card to a girl?

275
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,083
What did you write?

276
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,041
Oh, my! What happened after?

277
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,291
It was a nightmare.

278
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,000
I can’t tell you now.
But…

279
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,041
But don’t you ever do such stupid things.

280
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,333
-Not for my life.
-Gopi!

281
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,125
I read your card quite a few times.

282
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:40,583
Because it took me an hour
to understand your handwriting

283
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,875
But I liked your compliment.

284
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:46,541
Thanks.

285
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,541
But please next time
if you want to tell me something,

286
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:57,208
type it down so I don’t get a headache.

287
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,125
Hi, Mini.

288
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,666
Hi, Gopi!

289
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,583
How are you?

290
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,500
-I got fired.
-What?

291
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,041
I don’t know what to do.

292
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,958
Why will I be here if I am fired, Gopi?

293
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,666
They fired three people from my team.

294
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,041
How are you?

295
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,000
Shall we go for a movie
if you’re free today evening?

296
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,208
-With the team?
-Yes!

297
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,208
Uh, no! Just the two of us.

298
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,708
They are going elsewhere.

299
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,500
Just you and I…

300
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,625
Go for a movie
and if possible to dinner-

301
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:02,583
Sorry.

302
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:07,625
I am sorry, Gopi.
My uncle’s family is coming home.

303
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,125
I can’t.

304
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,500
That’s okay.

305
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,583
Same pinch.

306
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,166
People are losing job
left, right and center.

307
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,875
But you’re being promoted I hear.

308
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,291
You are lucky!

309
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,333
-See you. I have some work.
-Okay!

310
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,625
-Bye.
-Let’s go.

311
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,291
Not confirmed yet.

312
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,125
Modesty is the best policy, huh?

313
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:52,333
What? You lost your job?

314
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,583
Your face.

315
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,750
What?
She refused to go to movies?

316
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,833
-Why are you crying?
-She refused.

317
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,041
Not bad.
You asked her finally.

318
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,541
I thought you won’t ask.

319
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,750
Damn. I shouldn’t do such things.

320
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,333
Hey, hey!

321
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:08,333
It’s okay.
Don’t be upset.

322
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,166
Let us do something.

323
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,625
Nice bracelet!

324
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,500
Thanks, Lakshmi.

325
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,416
-Where did you find it?
-Hey, Lakshmi!

326
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:25,791
Is it gold?
Must be very expensive.

327
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,000
Very costly.

328
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,375
My mom bought it for eighty rupees
at Sultan Bazar.

329
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:32,541
Since you liked it so much,
I’ll give it to you for sixty rupees.

330
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:33,708
Do you want it?

331
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,875
Hey, where to?

332
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,333
Abdul.

333
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,833
No Abdul, nothing.
Leave.

334
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,666
Hey!

335
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,708
Hey, you!

336
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,291
Gopi, can you give me your room keys?

337
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,625
Only for an hour.

338
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,166
You said the same thing last time
and made me wait for three hours.

339
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,333
Don’t over do it.

340
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,208
Anyway, can you come
and clean the room if possible?

341
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,833
I will get you nice mutton biryani.

342
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,166
Hey!

343
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:04,041
Did the security guard
say something last time?

344
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,416
I know how to deal with him.

345
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,041
If we give too little,
it doesn’t work out.

346
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:13,000
If we give too much,
he gets suspicious.

347
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,833
You should learn how to manage.

348
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,500
You will take some time for that.

349
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,625
Gopi!

350
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,791
-What are you plans for the weekend?
-Nothing.

351
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,000
Can we meet?

352
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:25,833
Sure.

353
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,291
I am not that interested in restaurants.

354
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,666
Can we do something else?

355
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,041
Shall we go for a movie?

356
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,291
What movies?
I don’t think there are any nice ones.

357
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,458
I told you my uncle’s family
is coming over, right?

358
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,250
They are getting me a wine bottle.

359
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:45,166
If it is okay with you,

360
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,541
we can order food
and watch a movie in your room.

361
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:51,625
What do you say?

362
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:53,750
Fine.

363
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,708
Okay, then.
Bye.

364
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,166
Sorry, man. We made you wait.

365
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,625
-Hi!
-Hi.

366
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,666
There is biryani and also cake.
Finish them.

367
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,708
I just had dinner.
My stomach’s going to burst.

368
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:22,083
You are a lucky fellow.

369
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,291
Fine.
Biryani will taste better tomorrow.

370
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,208
Okay but use the room tomorrow
if you want.

371
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,500
It’s not possible on weekend.

372
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,083
Why not?

373
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,458
What is this smell?

374
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,750
No idea.
It is putrid.

375
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,291
I guess it is the garbage pile
from the next lane.

376
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:42,666
The area was nice earlier.

377
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:43,916
This started recently.

378
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,541
Is he going to stop us?

379
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,458
Bro, the stench is terrible.

380
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,333
-Don’t you get it?
-No.

381
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,625
Probably, your nose has gone numb
breathing it in all morning.

382
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,000
It must be some drainage leak.

383
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,125
Are you sure?

384
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,375
I hope it is not something that happened
in the market street.

385
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,916
Why?
What happened there?

386
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:07,625
That street was also stinking the same way
but no one paid attention.

387
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,625
When the guards got a complaint
and searched around,

388
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:11,250
they found a girl’s body in a car.

389
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,416
By then it was a week
since the girl committed suicide.

390
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,583
What? Really?

391
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,375
Let me check
where this smell is coming from.

392
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,500
Do that first.

393
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:19,916
Mini, come on.

394
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,708
Did that really happen?

395
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,041
No way.

396
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,500
I just blabbered something.

397
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,000
What?
Did you fake it?

398
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,125
Then?

399
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,083
Instead of doing their job,

400
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,000
the security interferes
into the personal lives of tenants.

401
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,375
Not bad, Gopi.

402
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,375
You are not as naive as I thought.

403
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,583
Don’t you have television?

404
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:44,041
I used to, but…

405
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,791
Nice. I like that.

406
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:49,541
Did you read all these books?
-No.

407
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:55,250
-Hey, do you play the guitar?
-No

408
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,208
Where did you get these frames done?

409
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,916
There is a studio near our office.

410
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,458
-How much did they charge you for each?
-I don’t remember.

411
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:10,041
-Why didn’t even take a sip?
-It’s okay.

412
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,583
What’s ok?

413
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:15,750
You’re sitting idle as I drink alone?

414
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,875
Come here.

415
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,666
-Do you have candles?
-Yes, I do.

416
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,833
-Ouch!
-Careful.

417
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,541
The match box must be somewhere here.

418
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,208
Yes, found it.

419
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:01,375
Sit.

420
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:12,500
What?

421
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,708
Sit and I will tell you.

422
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:30,833
Can you hear?

423
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,750
I saw you take the freshener.

424
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,791
-Who is it?
-I don’t know.

425
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,375
Is it your owner?

426
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:55,625
No idea.

427
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,916
Go and check!

428
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:58,583
If you don’t mind,
can you go into that room and wait?

429
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,875
-What?
-Please.

430
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,750
Madam Neelam!

431
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,333
What happened?

432
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,541
Can you come home once?

433
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:19,541
Okay.
Give me two minutes.

434
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,666
I will be back in ten minutes.

435
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,833
What?
Are you kidding me?

436
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,791
What do you think the time is?

437
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:35,500
Who is she?

438
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,333
Why are you going
to her house at this hour?

439
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,708
I think she has some problem.

440
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,583
-They have no one to help them.
-So?

441
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:43,208
Trust me.
I will be back in five minutes.

442
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,666
Mini, where are you going?

443
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,083
I am going home.

444
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,291
What?

445
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,291
It’s okay.

446
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,125
How will you go home?

447
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:55,625
I said I will be back in two minutes.

448
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:57,541
I will take a cab.
It’s quite late already.

449
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,666
Wait for a while, Mini. Please!

450
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,833
No, I can’t.
-Oh!

451
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:06,458
Then, can you wait and leave
when there is no one around?

452
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,541
Leave the keys in the flower pot. Okay?

453
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,000
Madam Neelam!

454
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:20,333
Why are you crying?
What happened?

455
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,875
She is talking nonsense.

456
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:24,875
She is acting weird.

457
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,833
I am not able to understand anything.

458
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,250
What are you talking about?

459
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,458
Nazia?

460
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:31,958
Nazia?

461
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,458
Nazia, what happened?

462
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,250
What does he think of me?

463
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:52,291
He underestimated me.

464
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:54,291
Who are you talking about?

465
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,416
See!

466
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,541
How he is looking at me!

467
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:02,125
He underestimated my power.

468
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,833
-Who?
-Who else?

469
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,958
It’s him.

470
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:09,625
I will not spare anyone.

471
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,916
Gopi, are you okay?

472
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,500
Gopi! Are you okay?

473
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:23,666
Wait.

474
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,250
Here.

475
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:35,083
Gopi!

476
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,250
Gopi! Where are you going?

477
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,375
I will bring someone.

478
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,750
-I will bring doctor!
-No, no, no!

479
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,833
If others come to know
they will brand her insane.

480
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,625
Who will marry her later?

481
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,791
But will the doctor come home
at this hour?

482
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,541
What do we do then?

483
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:56,583
We can’t take her out in this state.

484
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,833
Can you do something?

485
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,500
What can I do?

486
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I don’t know.

487
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,458
I am sorry.

488
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,666
I don’t know.

489
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,333
I know I am troubling you.

490
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,041
But… what to do…

491
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:15,125
I just don’t know what to do.

492
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,750
-What are you doing?
-One second.

493
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,625
I am checking what should be done
when someone is possessed.

494
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,500
What?
Do you think Nazia is possessed?

495
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:33,125
No, no.

496
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:34,958
I don’t know.

497
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:36,583
Probably.

498
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:39,833
How are you looking it up?

499
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,583
No, no. Not possessed.

500
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,000
You are Muslims, right?

501
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,500
We better look in the Muslim section.

502
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,333
What do we do
when Jinn takes possession?

503
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:47,708
What?

504
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,958
Nothing.
Go and get something to eat.

505
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,625
A broom stick too.

506
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:52,875
Quickly, please.

507
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:56,375
Gopi!

508
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,708
There is something outside that window.

509
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,416
That’s a cat.

510
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:44,750
Nazia!

511
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:52,166
Nazia, have this.
I think you are hungry.

512
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,541
I believe you haven’t eaten
since evening?

513
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,500
Your mom told me.

514
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:00,041
You are hungry. That’s all.

515
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:02,000
See. There is no one.

516
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,041
Eat.

517
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Take it.

518
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,000
Let’s wait for the reports.

519
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,791
Depending on them we will go for
more tests if necessary.

520
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,250
If nothing works out,

521
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,833
I will refer you to a specialist I know.

522
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,833
When did you come back from college?

523
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,791
At five in the evening.

524
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,250
What did you do after coming back?

525
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,333
I studied for some time
and then I painted.

526
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:55,333
How long did you paint?

527
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,000
I don’t remember.

528
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,333
She doesn’t remember
anything you mentioned.

529
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,375
Let her be for now.

530
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:14,416
There is no need
to tell her everything and trouble her.

531
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:17,458
Was she hurt in the head in the past?

532
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:18,750
No.

533
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,708
Is she stressed?

534
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:23,125
About studies or something else?

535
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,083
No.

536
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,041
What are you to the girl?
Her brother?

537
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,083
-No.
-He is like our family member.

538
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,958
A very close person.

539
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:32,250
Your husband?

540
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,500
We separated long ago.

541
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:37,208
-Do you exercise?
-No.

542
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:40,833
For a proper blood pumping,
you must exercise regularly.

543
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:43,125
Okay.

544
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:47,083
Your narration and her behaviour
don’t tally at all.

545
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:49,750
Make sure she takes the tablets on time.

546
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,291
She will be fine.

547
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,375
Try not to panic.

548
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:54,708
Have patience.

549
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:55,875
Be positive.

550
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:30,791
I don’t think
she will be cured with medication, Gopi!

551
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,458
She looks fine right now.

552
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,791
Sometimes she acts so weird…

553
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:37,708
It’s better to take her to a Peer Baba,

554
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:39,166
what do you say?

555
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,958
I don’t know.

556
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,291
I have absolutely no idea.

557
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:52,375
Are you surprised to hear this
from a science teacher?

558
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,083
It’s important that Nazia gets well.

559
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:57,166
Be it tablets or a Peer Baba.

560
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,291
Whatever works for her.

561
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:02,416
I said no one will come forward to marry her,
if they know about her, right?

562
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,666
Did I sound orthodox?

563
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:05,958
Not at all.

564
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:07,500
You have your own fears.

565
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:10,708
I don’t know.

566
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:14,166
I teach kids about the Sun and the stars.

567
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:16,750
Now, here I am thinking of Babas.

568
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,166
Do you know any Peer Baba?

569
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:21,625
No.

570
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,375
-Don’t you know?
-No!

571
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,583
We played a game yesterday.
It was great fun.

572
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,041
I’ll give you three names.

573
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:39,541
Tell me whom will you choose
for what and why.

574
00:46:39,791 --> 00:46:41,041
Gopi! Hey, Gopi!

575
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,791
-Hey, Gopi!
-What is it?

576
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:44,875
This game is called KMF.

577
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:48,208
K for Kill, M for Marry
and you know F.

578
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:49,541
Your options-

579
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,250
Thug beharam, Baba Ram Rahim,

580
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,375
-Mohan Kumar…
-Who is this Mohan Kumar now?

581
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:55,541
A serial killer
who murdered more than 20 people.

582
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:58,083
He would select aged,
single women who couldn’t give dowry,

583
00:46:58,166 --> 00:47:01,041
marry them, kill them and take off
with their money and gold.

584
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,125
Hey!

585
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:04,708
And he did all this while working
as a PET in a school for 23 years.

586
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:06,375
-Oh my!
-Tell me. What is your answer?

587
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,375
Hi, Mini.

588
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,333
-Hi.
-How are you?

589
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:11,583
Good.

590
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,083
-You?
-Good!

591
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:20,041
-I got to go.
-Okay, bye.

592
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:24,125
So, tell me Gopi.

593
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,916
Whom would you marry?
Whom would you kill?

594
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,250
-And whom would you…
-Stop it.

595
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:29,708
I don’t want to do anything with anyone.
Stop your boring questions.

596
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,958
I’m already worried about my love story-

597
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:34,208
Hey, Gopi! First of all
these are not boring questions.

598
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,541
It’s you who is boring.

599
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:37,291
They play these games for fun.

600
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,000
No one takes them seriously as you do.

601
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,500
Second of all,
yours is not a love story at all.

602
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,666
-These questions actually-
-I have a question.

603
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,708
Do you know any exorcising babas?

604
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:48,333
What stupid question is that?

605
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,666
Yes or no?

606
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,041
No one has answers for such questions.

607
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:54,000
Sorry. I simply asked.

608
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:55,750
Simply?

609
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:58,333
You have the exclusive right
to ask questions all the day?

610
00:47:58,416 --> 00:47:59,583
Can’t I ask any for fun?

611
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,166
That’s a bad cover-up.

612
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,458
Tell me, why did you ask?

613
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,000
I have a friend in my apartment.

614
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:07,250
He is making a short film.

615
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:08,708
He asked me this for research.

616
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:11,291
Do they also make short films
in your rusty apartment?

617
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,500
Who is this friend I never heard of?
Huh?

618
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,708
Shut up and tell me the truth, Gopi.

619
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:21,750
Hey!

620
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:25,166
Have you gone insane?

621
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:27,541
What if she kicked you in your face.

622
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:29,833
Pouncing and-

623
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:35,375
What if she pounced on you and bit you?

624
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:37,291
Nothing like that would’ve happened.

625
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:39,541
When did you become an expert in this?

626
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:43,916
Gopi!

627
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:46,250
Can you give me
your flat keys for tonight?

628
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:47,583
I am sorry. I can’t.

629
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:48,958
How about the weekend?

630
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,125
No. I am sorry.
It’s not possible for a few days.

631
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,958
Okay.
At least I am happy for you.

632
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:54,708
He is not so lucky.

633
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:58,208
Secretary said he will throw him out
of the apartment if he sees girls around

634
00:48:58,958 --> 00:48:59,791
Okay.

635
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:03,708
Hey, do you know any Peer Babas?

636
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:04,833
What?

637
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:06,958
He is under stress
and he doesn’t know what he is saying.

638
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Carry on.

639
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:10,583
Hey, how would he know?

640
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,125
Is his uncle some fakir?

641
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:13,875
-You…
-Thanks.

642
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,208
Hey, where to?

643
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,541
Doing same when we are going there.

644
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:24,791
I need some information.

645
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:28,291
Will you pay me hundred rupees?

646
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,083
I am going to Ajmer Sharif.

647
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,958
I will pray for you.

648
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:37,625
You are giving whole-heartedly, right?

649
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:43,041
Do you know any Peer Baba
who can drive away spirits?

650
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:49,041
What for?

651
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,541
I think a girl I know is possessed.

652
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,166
Careful.

653
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,583
Think twice before you blabber something.

654
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:59,041
Get it?

655
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:03,125
-Do you know Ibrahimpatnam?
-Yes.

656
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:05,375
It is somewhere on the city outskirts, right?

657
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:09,416
When you go sixty kilometres in from there,

658
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:11,916
-you will find a forest.
-Okay!

659
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,583
When you enter the forest,

660
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:16,541
you will find a 300 year old banyan tree.

661
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,375
You must go there
only on full moon day.

662
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:23,333
-Wear a white lungi when you go.
-Okay.

663
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,666
-Exactly at one in the night…
-Okay.

664
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,958
-Exactly at one in the night…
-Okay.

665
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:29,500
Remove the lungi.

666
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,916
What?

667
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:36,625
Hey, I was pulling your leg.

668
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,916
Why are you not laughing?
You didn’t like the joke?

669
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,708
When you laugh at your own joke,
it’s not called a joke.

670
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,166
That’s nice thing you said.

671
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,375
Sayed Rizwaan Hussain Shah wali Hajratt.

672
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:51,125
For generations, their family
has been helping those possessed.

673
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:53,041
It’s located near Uppal.

674
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:55,416
You’ll be there in 2 hours by Uber!

675
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:56,791
Thanks.

676
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:58,458
Oye!

677
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:00,458
-What is your name?
-Gopi Krishna.

678
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:02,000
Careful, Krishna!

679
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:04,500
It’s very difficult to recover from a blow

680
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:05,875
-We want to meet Peer Baba.
-Do you have an appointment?

681
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,583
Fine. Please, sit there.

682
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:47,000
Are you scared, son?

683
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:49,041
Don’t be.

684
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,000
That’s a street dog barking.

685
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:02,250
You don’t have to be afraid yet.

686
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,583
The actual fright is ahead.

687
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,625
Please, go in.

688
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:20,416
Meet Alauddin Baba.

689
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:22,750
Go straight and turn right.

690
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:16,375
Hey!

691
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:21,250
What are you doing here?

692
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,041
-You shouldn’t be here.
-Sorry!

693
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,291
You?

694
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:35,583
Gopi!

695
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:37,583
What?

696
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:38,708
He is Gopi.

697
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,250
He is with me.

698
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,041
He is my neighbour.

699
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:45,166
Sit down.

700
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,041
-When it happened, were you there with her?
-Yes.

701
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,833
It was Gopi who first felt
she was possessed.

702
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:02,041
-What made you feel so?
-I don’t know.

703
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,916
In my younger days once while I was moving
the carrom board I felt something stung me

704
00:55:04,958 --> 00:55:06,916
and yelled out “scorpion”

705
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:10,166
As they moved the carrom board
and checked it really was a scorpion

706
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,708
I never saw a scorpion in my life till then.

707
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,333
Still, I felt it.

708
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,541
-Did this happen earlier also?
-No.

709
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:21,458
But…for the past few days,
she has been talking in sleep.

710
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:23,500
Any sleep walking?

711
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,083
No!

712
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,708
Any bad smell at home?

713
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,875
Not at home.
But there is a garbage pile in the next lane.

714
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,458
Sometimes the stench is unbearable.

715
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:41,875
Tie this talisman to your daughter’s hand.

716
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:44,625
Will this work even if she
doesn’t believe in god?

717
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:46,541
Do you believe in god?

718
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:49,958
Whether we believe in god
or not makes no difference to him.

719
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,625
Just because we don’t believe in ghost,
it won’t let us off.

720
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:53,958
Who said that?

721
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:55,291
I saw it in an old English movie.

722
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:59,541
It’s enough if either of you believes.

723
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:01,500
I believe.

724
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:04,583
What? Is that all?

725
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:06,125
Will this talisman do?

726
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,916
Won’t you see the girl?

727
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,500
I would have…
but she is not here.

728
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:15,291
Don’t worry.

729
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:17,000
It only happened once.

730
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,916
It’s not too dangerous.

731
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:22,041
Otherwise I would have personally
taken you to Baba.

732
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,583
But it is not necessary.

733
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:26,875
Look. Such incidents
normally don’t repeat.

734
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,000
A nightmare might have
had that impact on her.

735
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:33,625
If it happens again,
bring her here.

736
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:36,083
If she refuses to come,
I will come and see her myself.

737
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,583
Everything will be fine.

738
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:40,208
-Okay?
-No idea.

739
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,333
-Okay?
-Okay.

740
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,083
You can go.

741
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,000
-Happy?
-Yes.

742
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:51,458
-So this is going to protect us?
-Yes.

743
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,541
Mom?

744
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,666
Why didn’t you do this earlier?

745
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:59,541
You were annoyed
when I asked you to come.

746
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,250
I am not talking about yesterday.

747
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:05,041
Why didn’t you and I wear
the talisman much earlier?

748
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:08,750
In fact,
had the government made this compulsory,

749
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,458
no one would have problems.

750
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:11,625
Shut up.

751
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:14,041
Use shut up for everything.
A fine escape.

752
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,750
How much did you pay the Baba?

753
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,375
Tell me. How much?

754
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:20,083
You shouldn’t lie in these things.

755
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:22,291
-Three hundred.
-That’s all?

756
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:25,458
300 for the consultation.

757
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:26,875
500 for the talisman.

758
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,000
Oh, my! 500 rupees for a thread?

759
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:32,875
Thanks to gullible people like you,
Babas are minting money.

760
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,708
Yes. You are the only clever person
in the world.

761
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,708
Great people including
science professors come there.

762
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,291
What do you say to that?

763
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:42,208
There is no dearth
of stupid people in the world.

764
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,708
-Shut up!
-Ouch!

765
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:45,666
What happened?

766
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,041
Nothing.

767
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,333
Forget about passing your exams.

768
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:05,208
My neighbours wanted a maid.

769
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:06,458
I will give them your name.

770
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:11,166
What sort of marks are these?

771
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,000
You get math through practice.

772
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:15,833
Not from painting and talismans.

773
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,583
My mom is going crazy by the day.

774
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:27,375
Why do you say that?

775
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:30,291
She always seems to be in some pain.

776
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:35,416
She has no friends to share her pain
or at least to talk to.

777
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:40,041
She met some Baba recently
and got me this talisman.

778
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:42,416
She says it will solve all our problems.

779
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:50,208
The primary duty of moms is to torture
their kids with their own worry for them.

780
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:54,208
Our primary responsibility
as kids is to escape them.

781
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:56,000
Yes.
You are right.

782
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,958
Hey, are you crazy?

783
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,041
Your mom must have done some ritual
and got it for you.

784
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:04,958
You could have kept it at least for a
couple of days for all the trouble she took.

785
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,916
Okay. Let’s go to the class.

786
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:11,291
Go ahead.
I will come later.

787
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:12,541
As you wish.

788
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,458
Shall I buy you one?

789
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,333
I am sorry I had to leave that day.

790
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:08,791
Office colleagues are planning for a goa trip.

791
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,458
-You too-
-I am not interested.

792
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,500
I am sorry, Mini.
Please.

793
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:16,958
-What happened that day?
-Nothing happened.

794
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,250
But you left because
there was some problem

795
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:21,000
Oh, that?
It was okay.

796
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:23,125
They had a short circuit at home.

797
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:24,833
Are you not going to Goa?

798
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:26,666
Are you going?

799
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:28,083
That…

800
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:41,583
I haven’t decided yet.

801
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,750
If you are coming,
I’ll think about it.

802
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,291
-Are you coming?
-No idea.

803
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:01,791
That was a balloon, Gopi.

804
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,000
How can that scare you?

805
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,333
Balloon?

806
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:06,708
But it burst like a bomb!

807
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:08,666
That’s why no one got scared except you.

808
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:13,333
Let’s go to Goa, Mini.

809
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,333
Will you leave me like last time?

810
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:21,000
I have already said sorry.

811
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:23,208
Okay, then.

812
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:24,583
-Bye.
-Okay.

813
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:26,458
Bye.

814
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,333
Nazia!

815
01:02:43,666 --> 01:02:44,833
Nazia!

816
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:51,666
What are you doing here?

817
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,041
Don’t you have a class?

818
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:55,666
What happened to you?

819
01:02:58,375 --> 01:02:59,833
Why are you sweating like that?

820
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:01,583
Why is your cheek bruised?

821
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,166
What is happening?

822
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:06,541
You are bleeding from the nose.

823
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:11,083
Nazia!

824
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:16,041
Our solar system is so mysterious...

825
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:17,333
Neelam ma’am!

826
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:21,375
Nazia?

827
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:27,875
Neelam!

828
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,250
Wake me up if you want something.

829
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:07,958
Where did you get this from?

830
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,083
Lakshmi gave me.

831
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:12,083
It looks very expensive.

832
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:15,083
She bought it from a shop near her house.

833
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:18,833
It’s sixty rupees.

834
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:20,083
Do you like it?

835
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:21,500
It’s very nice.

836
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,333
Go to sleep now.

837
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,250
Save me!

838
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,541
Help!

839
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:49,625
Help!

840
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,458
Save me!

841
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:10,916
Save me!

842
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:18,083
Help! Help!

843
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,833
Yuvaraj! What happened?

844
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:28,500
What happened? Huh?

845
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:30,916
Nazia…

846
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:32,583
Nazia?

847
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:33,708
Nazia…

848
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:34,791
Nazia…

849
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:36,791
Nazia!

850
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:38,791
Nazia!

851
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:51,500
Do you have allergy?

852
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:54,458
Please don’t mind me asking this.

853
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,625
When you fall sick,
do you treat yourself?

854
01:08:57,791 --> 01:08:59,125
Or do you see a doctor?

855
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,375
Sorry. I didn’t mean to annoy you.
Sorry.

856
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,625
Do you know her?

857
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:35,541
Why would I know a beggar?

858
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,625
-Crazy!
-Then…

859
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:39,583
-Why was she laughing at you then?
-Hey!

860
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:41,708
She wasn’t laughing at me.

861
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,125
It was at you.

862
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,125
Probably you reminded her of someone.

863
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:52,666
She will be asleep for a few hours.

864
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:54,458
You can go eat something.

865
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:55,625
I am right here.

866
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:11,208
Mom!

867
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:12,625
Nazia!

868
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:15,416
-What’s happened to me, mom?
-Nothing, dear.

869
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:16,666
I don’t want to stay here.

870
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:18,916
-It’s fine. What’s worrying you?
-I am very scared.

871
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:20,625
-It’s nothing. Don’t be afraid.
-Mom!

872
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:21,708
What’s wrong with me, mom?

873
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,166
Nothing.
Don’t be scared.

874
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,125
I don’t want to stay here at all.

875
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:27,166
How strange!
How did she wake up so soon?

876
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:30,291
For the kind of jab she got,
she should be asleep for hours!

877
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:32,791
-Close those windows, please.
-Okay!

878
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:38,083
Don’t let him come here.

879
01:10:38,666 --> 01:10:40,125
Who are you talking about?

880
01:10:40,166 --> 01:10:42,416
-There is no one here.
-Don’t let him come here!

881
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:44,625
Nazia!

882
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:48,500
Nazia, Nazia!

883
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:51,416
-What’s happening, Nazia? Nazia…
-Why is he coming here?

884
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,458
Nazia, there is no one here, Nazia.

885
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:57,208
Mom!

886
01:10:57,583 --> 01:11:00,166
Please, mom.
Please take me home.

887
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,083
-Mom, please!
-Okay, okay.

888
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:04,208
Please! Please mom!

889
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:06,458
Mom! Mom!

890
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,333
Mom!

891
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:09,625
-Mom!
-Nazia!

892
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:17,333
Nazia, please, Nazia.

893
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:19,625
Nazia! You will be fine. Please.

894
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,583
-Nazia!
-Nazia…

895
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:25,458
Nazia, calm down, Nazia.

896
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,333
-Nazia!
-Nazia!

897
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,208
Discard that useless thread.

898
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,791
Do you have the guts
to touch me? Dog!

899
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,541
Nazia… he is a nice person, Nazia.

900
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:44,791
He is here to help us.
Please, Nazia!

901
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:51,750
Stop him and I will give you
whatever you want.

902
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:54,291
Tell me, Gopi.
What do you want?

903
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:56,083
Do you want me?

904
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:57,458
Nazia, please!

905
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:00,083
-Nazia!
-Mom, please mom!

906
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:01,791
Stop him, mom. Please!

907
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:04,083
-Okay! Nazia…
-Please! Stop him, mom!

908
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:05,750
-Hey, where are you going?
-Mom! Please.

909
01:12:06,041 --> 01:12:07,083
Hey!

910
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:09,750
-Please!
-Please, mom.

911
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:13,208
-Please calm down.
-Nazia…

912
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,541
Gopi, I know how much you want it.

913
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:18,333
-If you stop him, I am yours.
-Nazia!

914
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,125
-Nazia, please don’t talk like that!
-Hey!

915
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:22,208
I will drink your blood, scoundrel!

916
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:23,250
Nazia! Please, dear.

917
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:24,583
Shut up, bitch!

918
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,125
I will gouge your eyes out.

919
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,541
Nazia! Nazia!

920
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:33,250
Nazia!

921
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:40,291
-Nazia!
-Please, Nazia.

922
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:43,125
Nazia!

923
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,750
What is happening here?

924
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:14,125
Who the heck are you?

925
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:15,625
This is Alauddin.

926
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,458
He came to tie talisman to Nazia.

927
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:20,250
Try this nonsense at home.
This is a hospital.

928
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:22,541
If I see him here again
I will kick all of you out.

929
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:23,625
Get lost from here!

930
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:29,416
Are you out of your mind?

931
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,291
Being a Physics teacher how can you
believe in this stuff?

932
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:32,333
Have you no sense?

933
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:34,250
Get out!

934
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,541
Considering her situation,

935
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:45,625
the doctor has advised shock treatment.

936
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:47,375
I don’t know what to do…

937
01:13:47,458 --> 01:13:48,541
I cannot stop her.

938
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,208
Meet Baba immediately.

939
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:58,250
Gopi! Gopi, get up!

940
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:00,791
What is it?

941
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,416
Let’s take Nazia from here.

942
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:04,250
-What?
-Get up. Let’s go.

943
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:05,416
Let’s take Nazia from here.

944
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:06,625
I understood that. But why?

945
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:08,791
I don’t want shock treatment
for my daughter.

946
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:12,375
Careful.

947
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,291
Check if there is someone there.

948
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:27,250
Doctor anyway said he’ll throw us out.

949
01:14:27,291 --> 01:14:28,458
Should we do this now?

950
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,500
If she gets up now,

951
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,666
-how do we control her?
-Shh!

952
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:32,083
We cannot take care, can we?

953
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,458
Alauddin said he will take care.

954
01:15:56,791 --> 01:15:58,375
Nothing to worry.

955
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:00,791
She would be perfectly okay.

956
01:16:01,291 --> 01:16:02,375
But…

957
01:16:04,416 --> 01:16:06,416
-Nazia Hasan’s mom?
-Yes.

958
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:09,625
What about you, Gajendra?

959
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:11,791
I am Gopi, sir.

960
01:16:11,791 --> 01:16:13,208
Gopi.

961
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:15,666
What is your story?

962
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,125
My story?

963
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:19,458
You are involved in this
from the beginning.

964
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,708
I live in the apartment next to theirs.

965
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,291
I know that.

966
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:25,666
Look…

967
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,375
Please get me that book.
Use the chair.

968
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:34,125
There is a reason behind every incident.

969
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:38,083
I am trying to see
how all these incidents are connected.

970
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:42,458
Do you live alone in your flat?

971
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:44,500
I am alone right now.

972
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,416
My roommate left for US six months ago.

973
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:56,250
What about your parents?

974
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:57,708
They live in the village.

975
01:16:58,458 --> 01:16:59,500
Siblings?

976
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:02,250
I have a brother. He is married.
He lives in Bombay.

977
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:07,625
Have you seen any such incident earlier?

978
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,083
As a kid I saw a possessed woman.

979
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,083
It is still vivid before me.

980
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:17,708
She wouldn’t even blink her wide eyes
and scream something.

981
01:17:18,791 --> 01:17:21,250
Out of ignorance,
I joked about her and she came chasing me.

982
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:24,458
With all their might,
four strong men tried to stop her.

983
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:27,291
I was so scared I wet my pants.

984
01:17:28,291 --> 01:17:29,416
I had fever for four days.

985
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:35,666
-Is my daughter possessed?
-There is a chance.

986
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:51,458
Aunty!

987
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:53,291
Aunty, save me, please!

988
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,625
Please, aunty!

989
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:03,083
Brother, brother,
at least you help me, please.

990
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:05,291
They will kill me, brother.

991
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:07,208
Please, brother.

992
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,458
Please?

993
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:10,666
Please…!

994
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:13,541
Please, brother.
Help me, brother!

995
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:15,041
Please!

996
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,041
Let’s go out and talk.

997
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:21,708
Do you think,
you’re great enough to cure anything?

998
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,416
I have to perform a ritual.

999
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:31,583
I need two blood relatives for that.

1000
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:34,291
Okay?

1001
01:19:38,041 --> 01:19:41,291
I will come and meet her soon!

1002
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:43,375
My daughter will get well, won’t she?

1003
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,583
I heard you cured every single person
who came to you.

1004
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:51,041
If I can cure all ills,

1005
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:54,708
I would have treated my ear first.

1006
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:00,791
Its high time for her now,

1007
01:20:01,416 --> 01:20:03,166
so that’s how she will behave.

1008
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:05,166
High time?

1009
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:18,291
-Thanks a lot, Alauddin.
-No problem, madam.

1010
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:21,125
Where are you, Gopi?

1011
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:23,291
I have been trying
since two hours.

1012
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:24,458
The train is about to start.

1013
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:26,125
Sorry, Mini. I am a bit sick.

1014
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,666
-I cannot come.
-What?

1015
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:29,291
I am a bit sick.

1016
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:30,791
I cannot come.

1017
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:32,250
I just don’t get it, Gopi.

1018
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:35,250
First you behave
as if you are really interested.

1019
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:37,500
I don’t know
what happens to you later.

1020
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,250
I really wanted to come, Mini.

1021
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:40,625
-But…
-Just shut up!

1022
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,291
I have learnt a lesson.
Thanks.

1023
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:44,458
Mini! Mini!

1024
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:47,333
Don’t you understand
what I am telling you?

1025
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:50,041
So much is happening here
and what are you talking about?

1026
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:52,625
I will talk to you later.

1027
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,208
Is everything okay?

1028
01:20:57,791 --> 01:20:59,125
Go and sleep.

1029
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:00,791
You look tired.

1030
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:03,583
I will get you something to eat
after some time.

1031
01:21:04,541 --> 01:21:06,125
Are you making calls?

1032
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,041
-For what?
-Peer Baba said…

1033
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:11,083
he needs two male blood relatives.

1034
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,541
Will you speak to your husband?

1035
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:17,500
No.

1036
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:19,333
I don’t want to do that.

1037
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,458
I will do something.

1038
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:23,416
-Okay.
-Okay.

1039
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,625
Okay, Baba.

1040
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:57,500
Shall we go?

1041
01:21:57,583 --> 01:21:58,500
It’s upstairs.

1042
01:22:07,791 --> 01:22:10,541
Oh! So, you are here!

1043
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,125
How are you?

1044
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,375
I am Rizwaan.

1045
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,583
I came to check on you.

1046
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:25,291
You don’t have to be afraid at all.

1047
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:27,583
Nothing will happen to you.
Okay?

1048
01:22:28,416 --> 01:22:29,500
By the way,

1049
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:32,416
I forgot to ask.

1050
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:36,750
Did they name you after
Singer Nazia Hassan?

1051
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:40,333
-I am a huge fan of Nazia Hassan’s.
-So am I.

1052
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,500
Do you know her songs?

1053
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:47,500
Then you must sing me a song.

1054
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:50,291
She responds so well to you!

1055
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:55,333
Can I get some water?

1056
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,791
Masooda…

1057
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:53,791
That old house…

1058
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:56,083
Does anyone live there?

1059
01:23:57,583 --> 01:23:58,375
No!

1060
01:23:58,375 --> 01:24:00,125
For as long as I remember,

1061
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:01,583
it has been vacant.

1062
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:04,708
Then… what about that path?

1063
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:09,541
When we can’t stand the garbage smell
from the next lane,

1064
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:12,083
we use the path as short cut.

1065
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:17,041
Does Nazia also use the path?

1066
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,458
Yes! Sometimes…

1067
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:20,791
Did you talk to your husband?

1068
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:22,708
I… I will see.

1069
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,541
It’s almost done.

1070
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:26,583
Okay.

1071
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:30,625
I will go around and come back.

1072
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:33,250
You…

1073
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:36,458
will have to bring Nazia to us.

1074
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:54,750
What do you know about that house?

1075
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,083
It has been in shambles for 15 to 20 years.

1076
01:25:57,625 --> 01:25:59,458
They say someone was murdered there.

1077
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:04,250
The land has been in dispute ever since.

1078
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,416
What I feel is…

1079
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:10,208
Gajendra,

1080
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:14,416
can you get me the details
from the police station?

1081
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,250
Also, gather some information
on the house.

1082
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:22,250
Gajendra!

1083
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:26,000
Only this ear is a problem for me.

1084
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:28,583
This one is…

1085
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:34,208
I don’t get it.
What are you doing all this for?

1086
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:35,375
Who are they to you?

1087
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,500
People are losing jobs every day.

1088
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:39,250
Mini stopped talking as well.

1089
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:41,125
What’s happening?

1090
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,208
-Gopi, hi!
-Hi!

1091
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:45,666
Yuvaraj said the same thing this morning.

1092
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:47,250
He asked what I will get out of this.

1093
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,125
-Can I get your room keys for his weekend?
-Exactly.

1094
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:50,083
What did you expect?

1095
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:51,583
-Only for two hours.
-Not possible.

1096
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:57,583
Sorry. Please wait for two weeks.

1097
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:59,250
-Okay?
-Okay.

1098
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:02,541
Look at you,
Instead of telling me to not be selfish

1099
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:05,583
They are not your family members.
Just neighbours.

1100
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:08,166
A little help is fine but you don’t have
to go overboard.

1101
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:10,208
I never met anyone like that.

1102
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:11,708
Such nice people are very rare.

1103
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:13,666
Once Nazia gets better,
I will mind my job.

1104
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:15,083
Hey, hey!

1105
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:16,458
Sir!

1106
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:17,750
I need a few days’ leave.

1107
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,250
My health is not good.

1108
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:21,416
It’s not your health.
Your performance is not good.

1109
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:23,541
Forget the promotion.
You lost it anyway.

1110
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:25,125
At least try and keep your job.

1111
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:41,666
Since 2001, that house has been wasted
as no one lived there.

1112
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:44,500
A man killed his husband.

1113
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:45,750
It wore down since then.

1114
01:27:46,083 --> 01:27:47,250
A man killed his husband?

1115
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,541
Wife… he killed his wife.

1116
01:27:48,666 --> 01:27:49,750
My uncle told me.

1117
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,208
Someone named Meer taj…

1118
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:55,750
Mohammed Meer taj claimed…

1119
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,500
that it was his house
and he gave to his younger brother.

1120
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:06,500
Police refused him entry to the house
as his brother was the prime suspect…

1121
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:08,916
and interrogated Meer taj.
He in fact went back to his village due to this.

1122
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,416
Which village is Meer taj from?

1123
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:12,000
How can I meet him?

1124
01:28:12,041 --> 01:28:13,625
You will have to go
to the police station for that.

1125
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,666
My 3000?

1126
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:22,041
What?
But your uncle said it’s only 1500.

1127
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:23,416
True.

1128
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:25,250
I tried.

1129
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:28,250
I even gave you water.

1130
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:43,291
Thanks, sir.

1131
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:45,083
This picture was taken
when the house was in good shape.

1132
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:48,250
The dead body of a lady called Masooda Be
was found tied to a tree.

1133
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:52,416
As per the post mortem report,
they dragged her, tied to a tree…

1134
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,208
and brutally stabbed and killed her.

1135
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:57,416
The most terrible thing is…

1136
01:28:57,625 --> 01:29:00,250
12 days after the police buried her,

1137
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:02,750
someone dug up her grave
and stole the corpse.

1138
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,208
This is Masooda Be.

1139
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,250
This is her husband Mohammad Khaja.

1140
01:29:16,541 --> 01:29:21,250
I think it was her I saw last night.

1141
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,458
What?

1142
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:27,625
I suspect Masooda Be is trying
to possess Nazia.

1143
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:29,750
Why Nazia?

1144
01:29:30,041 --> 01:29:35,500
Some spirits possess the weak
and fulfill their wishes.

1145
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:39,541
-What does she want from Nazia?
-No idea.

1146
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:43,500
If they shift somewhere far,
will it help?

1147
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,041
It’s too late for that.

1148
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:49,125
Gopi!

1149
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:54,375
One minute.

1150
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,041
Where did you buy the bracelet
on Nazia’s hand?

1151
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:04,375
I didn’t.

1152
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:06,583
Her friend Lashmi gave her.

1153
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:08,166
She gave it?

1154
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:11,541
Did you see her give it?

1155
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:13,250
Nazia told me.

1156
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,416
She told you a lie.

1157
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:27,291
It has some unknown evil energy.

1158
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:30,250
When the time comes,
we will remove it.

1159
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:33,416
Let it be for now.

1160
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:39,750
I am going to perform the ritual
I spoke to you about.

1161
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:42,666
Be ready for everything.

1162
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,583
Aunty! My dad wants to see you.

1163
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:56,291
I will come in five minutes.

1164
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:57,500
He said right now.

1165
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:59,083
In two minutes then.

1166
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:00,583
-Please.
-Okay.

1167
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:24,750
Neelam Aunty!

1168
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:27,250
Coming, Yuvaraj!

1169
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:29,500
Turn off the stove after a while. Okay?

1170
01:31:37,666 --> 01:31:38,625
Nazia!

1171
01:31:41,416 --> 01:31:42,500
What happened, Nazia?

1172
01:31:42,625 --> 01:31:44,583
You think I will ever get well?

1173
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:47,291
You will be all fine in a month. Watch.
You have nothing to worry.

1174
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:49,458
I don’t want to be burden to my mom.

1175
01:31:49,666 --> 01:31:50,666
Burden?

1176
01:31:51,041 --> 01:31:52,083
What are you saying?

1177
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:54,583
Your mom needs nothing
in this world except you.

1178
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:57,125
I don’t want to trouble you this way either.

1179
01:31:57,333 --> 01:31:58,583
This is no trouble at all!

1180
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,166
Then why are you going round the house
to find out about me, man??

1181
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:03,583
What?

1182
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:39,250
What is this, Gopi?

1183
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:40,541
-What happened?
-Gopi, you are bleeding.

1184
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,125
What happened, Gopi?

1185
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:43,541
Gopi… Gopi!

1186
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,375
Hey, will you tell or should I?

1187
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:50,000
No. I will tell.

1188
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:52,333
This is your last chance.

1189
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,041
If you don’t say it now,

1190
01:32:54,083 --> 01:32:56,583
I am going to call up your father
and brother and tell them.

1191
01:32:56,583 --> 01:32:58,041
I said I will.

1192
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:04,125
How are you?

1193
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:05,583
Better.

1194
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,083
I have a slight fever.

1195
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,625
Take this.

1196
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:11,541
Hey, take it!

1197
01:33:12,125 --> 01:33:13,291
This is vermicelli pudding.

1198
01:33:14,041 --> 01:33:16,250
I know this is not the right time.

1199
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:18,208
It’s good for your taste buds.

1200
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:19,583
I don’t feel like eating right now.

1201
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,125
It’s okay. Have it.

1202
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:22,416
It tastes good.

1203
01:33:28,666 --> 01:33:30,208
I wanted to ask you something.

1204
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:31,583
I have something to tell you too.

1205
01:33:31,708 --> 01:33:32,750
What is it?

1206
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
That’s…

1207
01:33:34,416 --> 01:33:35,375
I…

1208
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:36,458
for me…

1209
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:37,583
That…

1210
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:39,166
I cannot go with you.

1211
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:42,375
Peer Baba also wanted someone
related by blood.

1212
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:45,333
So, there’s really nothing
I can do there.

1213
01:33:46,125 --> 01:33:47,166
I am sorry.

1214
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,583
I already have a lot of pending work
in the office.

1215
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,666
Also, I am not well.

1216
01:33:55,375 --> 01:33:57,166
-I…
-It’s okay, Gopi.

1217
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,083
No problem.

1218
01:34:00,458 --> 01:34:01,583
I will take care.

1219
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:03,916
Bye.

1220
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:11,250
Don’t pull a long face.

1221
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,416
You did the right thing.

1222
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,041
You will feel guilty till evening.

1223
01:34:15,458 --> 01:34:16,666
Then you’ll get used to it.

1224
01:34:20,708 --> 01:34:22,458
Wow! How delicious!

1225
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:34,125
Madam Neelam!

1226
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:37,125
You came to ask me something?

1227
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:38,666
Nothing.

1228
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:41,250
Bye.

1229
01:37:15,333 --> 01:37:17,375
Mini, isn’t that Gopi?

1230
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,166
Why is he talking to beggars?

1231
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:21,500
He is crazy.

1232
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:23,541
We need not talk about him.

1233
01:37:24,333 --> 01:37:26,375
I asked you to vacate the house.

1234
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:28,250
But in this situation-

1235
01:37:28,416 --> 01:37:30,666
You have a week.
I can’t be more clear.

1236
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,541
We asked for male relatives.

1237
01:37:35,208 --> 01:37:37,250
She is procrastinating.

1238
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:38,750
But she didn’t bring anyone till now.

1239
01:39:38,083 --> 01:39:39,583
Does Abdul Azeem live here?

1240
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:42,041
No. Aravind Swamy does.

1241
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:44,416
I am from the police department.

1242
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:45,750
Sir!

1243
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:47,083
Sorry, sir.

1244
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:48,500
This is the house.

1245
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:56,166
-What is it?
-You are Mr Abdul Azeem, right?

1246
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:58,000
-Who are you?
-I am Gopi.

1247
01:39:58,125 --> 01:39:59,500
I am Mrs Neelam’s neighbour.

1248
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:06,375
Come in!

1249
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:27,416
She acts like a strong woman
but I know her very well

1250
01:40:29,041 --> 01:40:30,583
I also know she is very stingy.

1251
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:35,250
-How much money did she send?
-What money?

1252
01:40:35,375 --> 01:40:36,750
I believe her daughter’s sick.

1253
01:40:38,416 --> 01:40:40,250
She told me she needs my help

1254
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:42,458
You want money to save
your own daughter?

1255
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:44,458
What sort of a father are you?

1256
01:40:45,166 --> 01:40:48,583
She works day and night to save her daughter
and you ask her for money?

1257
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:51,583
What is your connection with her?

1258
01:40:53,458 --> 01:40:55,708
-What are you to her?
-I am her neighbor.

1259
01:40:56,208 --> 01:40:57,666
Gopi is a Hindu.

1260
01:40:58,666 --> 01:41:00,166
Neelam is a Muslim.

1261
01:41:01,083 --> 01:41:02,625
She left her husband and lives alone.

1262
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:05,500
And you help her.

1263
01:41:08,666 --> 01:41:10,416
Isn’t it nasty to hear?

1264
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:12,458
Get up.

1265
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:15,583
Tell her.

1266
01:41:15,708 --> 01:41:18,291
I have no pity on either of them.

1267
01:41:20,083 --> 01:41:24,375
If she wants her husband’s help,
tell her to learn to be a woman first.

1268
01:41:25,916 --> 01:41:27,208
What are you staring at?

1269
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:28,708
Go!

1270
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:30,250
Go! Get lost you…

1271
01:41:50,166 --> 01:41:51,291
Have you any sense?

1272
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:53,500
Just because they are your neighbours,
how can you risk your life for them?

1273
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:55,541
You already told her you won’t help.

1274
01:41:55,625 --> 01:41:57,291
Why are you getting involved again?

1275
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,166
Look. I am going to inform your family.

1276
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:02,000
Did she come to you for help?

1277
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:03,625
Did she weep before you?

1278
01:42:03,708 --> 01:42:05,458
She is blackmailing you emotionally.

1279
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,250
You were fine till yesterday.

1280
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:08,708
What came over you all of a sudden?

1281
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:10,416
I know what a wimp you are!

1282
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:12,541
How can you fight spirits and ghosts?

1283
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:15,583
Look, I say this for your own good.
This is not your cup of tea.

1284
01:42:15,708 --> 01:42:17,583
Your stupid help will be of no use to them.

1285
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:19,125
It will be insignificant.

1286
01:42:20,083 --> 01:42:21,375
Hey, why don’t you answer me?

1287
01:42:21,375 --> 01:42:23,208
Why are you taking their problem
so personal?

1288
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:24,250
I don’t know!

1289
01:42:24,666 --> 01:42:27,500
I don’t know how else to be
when a girl is suffering in front of me

1290
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:29,750
It breaks my heart to see
the mother and daughter cry every day.

1291
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,541
I don’t know
how not to be affected.

1292
01:42:33,416 --> 01:42:35,333
I don’t know
how not to take it personally.

1293
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:39,750
Hey, Sudhakar!

1294
01:42:40,125 --> 01:42:41,583
Do you know what Gandhi said?

1295
01:42:42,458 --> 01:42:44,291
Whatever you do will be insignificant.

1296
01:42:45,416 --> 01:42:47,333
But it is very important that you do it.

1297
01:42:49,208 --> 01:42:50,500
I am doing what I can.

1298
01:42:56,416 --> 01:42:59,541
There is a lot I should know
about Masooda Be.

1299
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:01,750
We don’t know where she is.

1300
01:43:03,083 --> 01:43:05,250
We don’t even know
where she is buried.

1301
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,041
Who has the necessity
to dig out her body and take it?

1302
01:43:10,708 --> 01:43:12,583
We must find out about the bracelet.

1303
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,125
Where is Meer taj’s house?

1304
01:43:17,208 --> 01:43:18,541
Oh, you came for the funeral?

1305
01:43:18,666 --> 01:43:20,083
No. Whose funeral?

1306
01:43:20,125 --> 01:43:22,125
-Who else? Meertaj’s funeral.
-What?

1307
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:24,583
A month ago,
he met with an accident in Hyderabad.

1308
01:43:25,291 --> 01:43:27,083
He was in the hospital all these days.

1309
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:28,541
He died this morning.

1310
01:43:31,125 --> 01:43:32,250
Amen!

1311
01:43:55,416 --> 01:43:56,416
Hello…

1312
01:43:57,666 --> 01:43:58,666
Hello!

1313
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,583
Hello, is anyone home?

1314
01:44:17,291 --> 01:44:18,500
Who are you?

1315
01:44:19,416 --> 01:44:20,583
My name is Gopi.

1316
01:44:20,625 --> 01:44:24,416
I have come to collect some information
on Mohammad Khaja and his wife Masooda Be.

1317
01:44:28,083 --> 01:44:29,208
What happened?

1318
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:33,083
What did he do?

1319
01:44:37,375 --> 01:44:38,583
Hey, who are you, man?

1320
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:40,458
I am Gopi.
I came from Hyderabad.

1321
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:42,000
Send him away.

1322
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:44,083
How did you enter the house?
Who allowed you?

1323
01:44:44,458 --> 01:44:45,583
Please, bear with me.

1324
01:44:45,583 --> 01:44:47,250
I’ve come all the way from Hyderabad.

1325
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:50,583
I have come to talk about Meertaj’s brother,
and the house at Hyderabad.

1326
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Go away from here!

1327
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:53,708
-A girl called Nazia is in deep trouble.
-Move!

1328
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:55,500
The doctors fail to diagnose her problem.

1329
01:44:55,583 --> 01:44:57,500
Peer Baba says she is possessed.

1330
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,583
-I must find out what happened to Nazia.
-We cannot help you.

1331
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:01,166
What do you think of yourself?

1332
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:03,750
We are grieving over death in the family.
You don’t seem to care!

1333
01:45:04,583 --> 01:45:06,625
-Who is in the photograph?
-Hey, get out!

1334
01:45:07,291 --> 01:45:09,083
-Mother and daughter are in trouble.
-We don’t care.

1335
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:10,750
We are in trouble too.
Leave us alone.

1336
01:45:12,625 --> 01:45:13,625
Please, sir!

1337
01:45:14,083 --> 01:45:16,166
If you want, you can save her.
Please!

1338
01:45:51,541 --> 01:45:53,208
You said the girl is in deep trouble.

1339
01:45:53,416 --> 01:45:55,750
-That’s why I won’t waste your time.
-Thanks, madam.

1340
01:45:56,166 --> 01:45:58,291
What do you want?
What do you have on your mind?

1341
01:45:58,541 --> 01:46:00,250
I told you. Nazia…

1342
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:04,041
What do you want to achieve in life?

1343
01:46:04,083 --> 01:46:05,125
I don’t know all that.

1344
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:07,625
All that I want to know is
what happened to Masooda Be...

1345
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:09,333
and why is she after Nazia.

1346
01:46:09,416 --> 01:46:11,125
-Are you crazy?
-Please, don’t say that.

1347
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:13,041
- I couldn’t understand and…
-No, I am not saying that.

1348
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:15,416
I am only asking you.
Are you a bit crazy?

1349
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:18,250
A little.

1350
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:21,083
That’s good.

1351
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:24,541
If you suspect the truth in what I say,
it is a sheer waste of your time.

1352
01:46:25,083 --> 01:46:26,625
But if you can trust me,
I will tell you a few things.

1353
01:46:26,625 --> 01:46:28,000
Aunt Nargis!

1354
01:46:29,875 --> 01:46:31,583
Wait at the pond outside the village.

1355
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:33,500
I will answer your questions there.

1356
01:46:34,375 --> 01:46:36,000
Who was that in the photograph?

1357
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:38,625
Meer taj’s wife.
Why?

1358
01:46:40,375 --> 01:46:41,750
Nothing.
I just asked.

1359
01:46:53,125 --> 01:46:54,750
No one will even realise if I die here.

1360
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:04,875
Oh, my god!

1361
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:07,166
Who is there?

1362
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:15,208
Who is it?

1363
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,541
Don’t shout.

1364
01:47:17,708 --> 01:47:18,750
It’s me.

1365
01:47:19,125 --> 01:47:21,000
We should have met elsewhere.

1366
01:47:21,125 --> 01:47:23,041
Isn’t this the purpose of your visit
to this village?

1367
01:47:23,541 --> 01:47:24,458
Come.

1368
01:47:28,458 --> 01:47:31,083
I came here to find
what Masooda Be wants from Nazia.

1369
01:47:31,208 --> 01:47:32,416
That’s not our concern.

1370
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:33,666
How can you say that?

1371
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:35,458
Shouldn’t we find out what she wants?

1372
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:38,041
Masooda doesn’t belong to this world now.

1373
01:47:38,666 --> 01:47:40,500
We have no idea of her present world.

1374
01:47:40,958 --> 01:47:44,083
We don’t have to find the connection
between these two worlds.

1375
01:47:48,416 --> 01:47:50,208
You can’t agree with what I said, right?

1376
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:54,250
I can understand your interest.

1377
01:47:54,666 --> 01:47:57,458
But… it is of no use to us.

1378
01:47:59,083 --> 01:48:00,166
Come here.

1379
01:48:08,875 --> 01:48:10,375
Barring her second husband,

1380
01:48:10,458 --> 01:48:12,750
this is where Masooda Be
sacrificed many people.

1381
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:20,541
What?

1382
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:22,166
-What are you trying to say?
-Yes.

1383
01:48:22,541 --> 01:48:25,125
I have no idea how many people she killed
before coming here.

1384
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:27,041
I just don’t understand.

1385
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:29,041
It was her husband who killed her, right?

1386
01:48:29,333 --> 01:48:30,916
He killed her unjustly and ran away.

1387
01:48:30,916 --> 01:48:32,583
Isn’t that why her spirit
is still in the house?

1388
01:48:32,666 --> 01:48:34,708
No, no.
Her husband didn’t kill her.

1389
01:48:35,166 --> 01:48:37,041
Masooda Be is not human as you think.

1390
01:48:37,125 --> 01:48:38,375
-She is a devil.
-What?

1391
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:40,333
Masooda Be faced no injustice.

1392
01:48:40,875 --> 01:48:42,791
It was to Meer taj and his family.

1393
01:48:47,708 --> 01:48:51,750
Uncle Meer cultivated sugarcane
and also traded horses on the side.

1394
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:57,541
After I lost my parents,
it was uncle Meer who raised me.

1395
01:48:58,333 --> 01:48:59,500
He had three brothers.

1396
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:01,750
Fardeen, Khaja, Faisal.

1397
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:05,083
I have never seen siblings
with better bonding than them

1398
01:49:09,041 --> 01:49:11,416
His first younger brother, Fardeen,
was a good student.

1399
01:49:11,541 --> 01:49:14,000
He was the only one who could
study at the University level.

1400
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,875
We thought he was going
to change our destiny.

1401
01:49:20,166 --> 01:49:21,291
And he did.

1402
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:24,166
But not in the way we anticipated.

1403
01:49:27,291 --> 01:49:29,333
Kaja come inside.

1404
01:49:53,916 --> 01:49:57,250
Masooda came on the day
when one of our relatives died.

1405
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,333
We don’t know where she came from…

1406
01:50:00,916 --> 01:50:04,500
but from the moment she stepped in,
our lives turned upside down.

1407
01:50:23,583 --> 01:50:26,500
Uncle Meer and I never liked her.

1408
01:50:26,791 --> 01:50:28,791
Our minds warned us
of some impending disaster.

1409
01:51:02,041 --> 01:51:05,625
She was a witch and she was exercising
witchcraft on a few villagers.

1410
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:07,625
It didn’t take us too long
to discover this.

1411
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:20,708
Unable to tell Fardeen what he saw
Uncle Meer struggled within.

1412
01:51:26,583 --> 01:51:30,125
Then he noticed Masooda trap
her brother-in-law, Khaja…

1413
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:32,083
and couldn’t believe his eyes.

1414
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:35,708
Meer uncle tried to reason with his brother.

1415
01:51:35,875 --> 01:51:36,833
But…

1416
01:51:36,833 --> 01:51:38,791
Khaja was already under her spell.

1417
01:51:38,791 --> 01:51:40,250
What do you care how I live?

1418
01:51:41,375 --> 01:51:44,375
After a few days, a mysterious disease…

1419
01:51:44,708 --> 01:51:46,166
took over the villagers.

1420
01:52:31,208 --> 01:52:34,583
That day, I witnessed
the most horrible visual of my life.

1421
01:52:35,541 --> 01:52:37,666
An elder brother
under the spell of an evil power…

1422
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:39,875
was ready to sacrifice
his own younger brother

1423
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:46,666
Uncle Meer! Uncle Meer!

1424
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,083
I told Uncle Meer whatever I saw.

1425
01:53:03,125 --> 01:53:06,750
Meer uncle always suspected
that Masooda was evil energy.

1426
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:11,041
But he could not predict that
she would destroy his family.

1427
01:53:15,291 --> 01:53:18,083
By the time we reached there,
it was too late.

1428
01:53:19,458 --> 01:53:23,333
Uncle Meer decided to avenge the death
of his brothers.

1429
01:53:32,833 --> 01:53:37,333
To find Masooda, Uncle Meer started
hounding people who associates with her.

1430
01:53:37,916 --> 01:53:39,375
But it was futile!

1431
01:53:49,166 --> 01:53:51,250
Above his business and family,

1432
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:54,000
-revenge became Meer uncle’s priority.
-It’s been four days since you came home.

1433
01:53:54,125 --> 01:53:56,250
No one cares whether
we are dead or alive.

1434
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:58,500
Why don’t you speak?
Speak!

1435
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:00,291
Damn!

1436
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,041
People began to think he was insane.

1437
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,250
His wife couldn’t take it anymore
and left with her son.

1438
01:54:24,875 --> 01:54:29,958
It took Meer uncle years to find Masooda
and what she was up to.

1439
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:38,500
'Masooda was not just killing people.
She was sacrificing them to evoke evil.'

1440
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:42,041
'Unfortunatley, she has entered your life.'

1441
01:54:42,666 --> 01:54:45,125
‘She won’t stop until she achieves
what she wants.’

1442
01:54:45,166 --> 01:54:47,041
This is what Maulvi told Uncle Meer.

1443
01:54:57,375 --> 01:55:04,333
He gave a holy veil and a powerful dagger
to Meer uncle to use them against Masooda.

1444
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,041
Gathering a few brave men,
Meer uncle left for Hyderabad.

1445
01:55:39,916 --> 01:55:41,000
Uncle Meer!

1446
01:55:45,833 --> 01:55:47,458
We didn’t find Khaja anywhere.

1447
01:56:49,708 --> 01:56:53,041
No matter how much we tried,
Masooda didn’t confess to her sins.

1448
01:56:53,333 --> 01:56:55,375
There was no trace of fear in her face.

1449
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:59,166
Why did you do this to my brothers?

1450
01:56:59,166 --> 01:57:02,875
Why did you do it to my brothers?

1451
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:02,208
Even after killing Masooda,
Meer uncle had no peace.

1452
01:58:04,791 --> 01:58:08,916
Khaja was blindly in love with Masooda
and wanted to bring her back to life.

1453
01:58:09,333 --> 01:58:11,791
So, he unearthed Masooda’s body
from police grounds.

1454
01:58:19,041 --> 01:58:23,458
Using the witchcraft learnt from Masooda,
Khaja tried to ignite life in her.

1455
01:58:23,625 --> 01:58:28,375
But his job done with half-knowledge,
proved fatal for him.

1456
01:58:34,333 --> 01:58:35,583
Khaja!

1457
01:58:36,041 --> 01:58:37,083
Khaja!

1458
01:58:37,458 --> 01:58:38,416
Khaja!

1459
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:41,458
He told Meer uncle on Masooda’s atrocities.

1460
01:58:41,458 --> 01:58:43,708
-He revealed where Masooda’s body was.
-I made a grave mistake.

1461
01:58:43,833 --> 01:58:45,250
I deserve this.

1462
01:58:45,958 --> 01:58:47,208
Khaja!

1463
01:58:56,166 --> 01:58:58,250
After praying in a holy Minar,

1464
01:58:58,333 --> 01:59:00,666
Uncle Meer buried Masooda’s body
in woods!

1465
01:59:10,625 --> 01:59:11,916
I don’t understand.

1466
01:59:11,958 --> 01:59:13,708
Masooda was just a human being.

1467
01:59:14,041 --> 01:59:17,916
Yet a very strong man like Meer taj
only found it difficult to face her.

1468
01:59:18,291 --> 01:59:19,708
Now she is an evil power.

1469
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,375
Meer uncle is also not alive.

1470
01:59:21,833 --> 01:59:23,500
It’s going to be very hard for us.

1471
01:59:23,958 --> 01:59:25,583
-Are you ready?
-For what?

1472
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:27,250
Take this.

1473
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:30,583
From the main entrance,
take ten steps and turn right.

1474
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:33,541
Ten steps down from there
you will find a cave.

1475
01:59:33,916 --> 01:59:35,083
What, I should go into that now?

1476
01:59:35,083 --> 01:59:39,041
The veil used to kill Masooda was hidden
somewhere in the cave by Meer uncle.

1477
01:59:39,583 --> 01:59:41,541
It will come in handy for us
when we face her.

1478
01:59:41,583 --> 01:59:43,500
If he knew she would come back as a ghost,

1479
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:45,500
Meer uncle would have done something.

1480
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Don’t take the left under any circumstances.

1481
01:59:48,875 --> 01:59:51,166
That was Masooda’s spot
for murders and black magic.

1482
01:59:51,291 --> 01:59:52,666
Take only the right turn.

1483
01:59:52,875 --> 01:59:54,041
What did I say?

1484
01:59:54,125 --> 01:59:56,416
Take only the right and not left.

1485
01:59:57,666 --> 01:59:58,583
Go!

1486
02:00:06,625 --> 02:00:10,000
Ten feet down, walk ten steps to my right
and I reach the cave.

1487
02:00:10,208 --> 02:00:12,291
Good memory.
Go ahead now.

1488
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:17,875
-Is there anything else in there?
-You have train at 4 am.

1489
02:00:18,041 --> 02:00:19,708
You will miss it if you delay.

1490
02:03:50,291 --> 02:03:51,416
You are back!

1491
02:03:53,291 --> 02:03:54,625
You managed to get it!

1492
02:03:55,458 --> 02:03:56,375
Gopi!

1493
02:04:00,166 --> 02:04:02,291
Baba, Gopi is calling.

1494
02:05:09,708 --> 02:05:11,541
Whatever Peer Baba wanted
is all in the bag.

1495
02:05:11,541 --> 02:05:12,708
I got the car.

1496
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:15,333
We will go there and do whatever they say.

1497
02:05:15,541 --> 02:05:16,458
Let us…

1498
02:05:18,541 --> 02:05:20,708
Has someone from your family
agreed to go with you?

1499
02:05:21,916 --> 02:05:23,125
Shall we start then?

1500
02:05:24,375 --> 02:05:26,208
Before we leave,
you must meet someone.

1501
02:05:31,208 --> 02:05:32,125
Aunty!

1502
02:05:37,166 --> 02:05:41,666
At 2am, Gopi will spread the holy veil
on Masooda’s remains.

1503
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:44,875
That diminishes the energy of the spirit.

1504
02:05:45,333 --> 02:05:49,666
At that exact moment,
you remove the bracelet from Nazia’s wrist.

1505
02:05:50,708 --> 02:05:54,125
What we are about to do
is dangerous for all of us.

1506
02:05:54,666 --> 02:05:56,208
We have to be very cautious.

1507
02:06:00,208 --> 02:06:02,125
I will find the right time and go in.

1508
02:06:02,333 --> 02:06:03,458
You get going.

1509
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:13,833
Thanks, ma’am.

1510
02:06:17,541 --> 02:06:19,708
Masooda was killed using this.

1511
02:06:20,791 --> 02:06:21,833
What will I do with this?

1512
02:06:21,916 --> 02:06:23,666
You will know when the time comes.

1513
02:06:36,166 --> 02:06:37,125
What about you?

1514
02:06:37,125 --> 02:06:39,250
I know she will come for me some day.

1515
02:06:40,083 --> 02:06:41,708
I will be safe.
You go ahead.

1516
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:53,916
Why is he here?

1517
02:06:57,916 --> 02:06:59,416
Please, ma’am.
Wait.

1518
02:06:59,458 --> 02:07:00,416
Please.

1519
02:07:00,416 --> 02:07:01,625
But why has he come?

1520
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:03,708
He came voluntarily.
Let us go now.

1521
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,875
-Did you pay him?
-I didn’t.

1522
02:07:08,458 --> 02:07:09,958
It’s getting late.
We must leave.

1523
02:07:10,083 --> 02:07:11,000
Let’s go!

1524
02:07:24,083 --> 02:07:25,541
Why did you do that, Gopi?

1525
02:07:26,041 --> 02:07:29,083
I know you paid him money
for coming here.

1526
02:07:29,666 --> 02:07:30,666
I didn’t pay him.

1527
02:07:30,708 --> 02:07:33,083
Your face is giving away
that you’re lying.

1528
02:07:34,666 --> 02:07:36,083
He shouldn’t be there.

1529
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:40,041
I know he wouldn’t care whatever
happens to his own daughter.

1530
02:07:40,166 --> 02:07:42,250
Why discuss that now?
Let’s talk later.

1531
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,416
-Are you able to see anything?
-Yes, I am able to.

1532
02:07:48,458 --> 02:07:50,791
But will Peer Baba
able to execute his plan in this rain?

1533
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:06,083
I hope you are not hurt.

1534
02:08:06,583 --> 02:08:08,083
-What about you?
-I am fine.

1535
02:08:08,291 --> 02:08:09,333
What happened?

1536
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:20,125
It’s nothing.
I am sorry.

1537
02:08:22,291 --> 02:08:23,250
Okay. Let’s go.

1538
02:08:49,416 --> 02:08:50,791
Shall we begin?

1539
02:08:56,125 --> 02:08:58,250
You have three hours.

1540
02:08:58,583 --> 02:09:00,000
Dig up the grave…

1541
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:05,666
and when you find her remains,
cover them with this veil.

1542
02:09:06,333 --> 02:09:09,958
Exactly at 2 o’ clock, close the grave.

1543
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:13,750
It will try to stop you.

1544
02:09:15,083 --> 02:09:18,625
Masooda Be… will come for you.

1545
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:21,583
Don’t make the mistake of talking to her.

1546
02:09:21,833 --> 02:09:24,458
Because it’s a spirit.

1547
02:09:24,833 --> 02:09:26,375
If you talk to her,

1548
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:29,333
we won’t be able to save Nazia.

1549
02:09:33,541 --> 02:09:37,000
I know that you are very scared, Gopi.

1550
02:09:37,833 --> 02:09:41,416
But the courage you display today,

1551
02:09:41,625 --> 02:09:44,500
you may never need it in life again.

1552
02:09:46,791 --> 02:09:48,833
Unless you have a strong faith,

1553
02:09:49,333 --> 02:09:50,875
you cannot confront it.

1554
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,250
Don’t worry, Nazia.

1555
02:10:00,291 --> 02:10:01,500
Nothing will happen to you.

1556
02:10:05,375 --> 02:10:06,333
Gopi!

1557
02:11:02,416 --> 02:11:03,500
What is that?

1558
02:11:11,333 --> 02:11:12,416
What?

1559
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:38,500
I will gouge out even your other eye today.

1560
02:11:46,541 --> 02:11:49,958
Touch me and I will hang you upside down
and slit your throat.

1561
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,375
Where are you going?

1562
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:08,375
This… I can’t take all this.

1563
02:12:09,333 --> 02:12:11,750
For the stupid fifty thousand
Gopi is paying me,

1564
02:12:12,291 --> 02:12:13,333
I cannot do all this.

1565
02:12:13,333 --> 02:12:14,750
But you are her father, aren’t you?

1566
02:12:14,750 --> 02:12:16,291
Spare me the lecture.

1567
02:12:17,541 --> 02:12:21,000
Will you give me two lakhs?
Promise me and I will stay.

1568
02:12:37,583 --> 02:12:39,333
We dug so much
but can’t find anything.

1569
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:41,875
Probably, it isn’t here.

1570
02:13:00,708 --> 02:13:01,708
Pass me the veil.

1571
02:13:09,083 --> 02:13:10,250
Madam Neelam?

1572
02:13:13,166 --> 02:13:14,166
What happened?

1573
02:13:32,541 --> 02:13:33,541
Madam Neelam!

1574
02:14:01,291 --> 02:14:02,333
What’s wrong?

1575
02:14:02,416 --> 02:14:03,958
This chain has caught hold of my leg.

1576
02:14:03,958 --> 02:14:04,958
Which chain?

1577
02:14:05,291 --> 02:14:06,416
There is nothing!

1578
02:14:07,916 --> 02:14:09,750
I saw it on my leg!

1579
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:12,916
Gopi! Gopi, get up!

1580
02:15:13,375 --> 02:15:14,416
Gopi, get up!

1581
02:15:14,541 --> 02:15:15,708
Gopi!

1582
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:19,291
What happened?

1583
02:15:21,333 --> 02:15:22,833
I tried to climb out.

1584
02:15:23,708 --> 02:15:25,541
I know. I know, Gopi. I know.

1585
02:15:27,416 --> 02:15:28,500
Where is the veil?

1586
02:15:32,208 --> 02:15:34,000
Oh, no! It should be here.

1587
02:15:49,291 --> 02:15:50,500
Look that side.

1588
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:10,583
Alauddin!

1589
02:16:14,458 --> 02:16:15,666
Careful.

1590
02:16:26,333 --> 02:16:27,458
What was that scream?

1591
02:16:27,791 --> 02:16:29,541
It must be one of the patients in the ward.

1592
02:16:29,708 --> 02:16:30,791
Let me go check.

1593
02:16:41,875 --> 02:16:42,958
Aunty!

1594
02:16:47,916 --> 02:16:48,833
Gulfam!

1595
02:16:52,333 --> 02:16:53,416
Salman!

1596
02:17:01,416 --> 02:17:02,666
Salman, what happened?

1597
02:17:03,833 --> 02:17:04,833
I am fine.

1598
02:17:05,458 --> 02:17:06,416
Then?

1599
02:17:10,833 --> 02:17:11,666
Alauddin!

1600
02:17:11,666 --> 02:17:12,625
What happened?

1601
02:17:13,625 --> 02:17:14,791
Alauddin!

1602
02:17:17,583 --> 02:17:18,666
Are you okay?

1603
02:17:24,333 --> 02:17:25,416
What are you doing?

1604
02:17:26,291 --> 02:17:27,416
She is a kid.

1605
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:28,833
She is not Nazia.

1606
02:19:44,833 --> 02:19:46,750
It’s too high.
I don’t think we can reach it.

1607
02:19:54,541 --> 02:19:55,583
Careful!

1608
02:20:08,458 --> 02:20:09,458
Gopi!

1609
02:20:14,291 --> 02:20:15,333
Who is it?

1610
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:39,416
Nazia…

1611
02:20:41,333 --> 02:20:42,416
Nazia!

1612
02:20:45,291 --> 02:20:46,333
Nazia!

1613
02:22:00,833 --> 02:22:01,875
Who is it?

1614
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,333
Who are you?

1615
02:22:36,416 --> 02:22:37,541
Who are you?

1616
02:22:57,916 --> 02:22:58,750
Gopi!

1617
02:23:00,166 --> 02:23:01,083
Listen.

1618
02:23:06,083 --> 02:23:06,916
What?

1619
02:23:07,666 --> 02:23:08,875
I can’t hear anything.

1620
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:11,958
Let’s go.

1621
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:23,000
Mom!

1622
02:23:26,291 --> 02:23:27,958
Mom, please save me.

1623
02:23:28,875 --> 02:23:30,500
I am really scared.

1624
02:23:32,708 --> 02:23:33,750
Mom!

1625
02:23:34,750 --> 02:23:36,750
No Gopi, that’s not Nazia

1626
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:42,625
How dare you, man!

1627
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:44,916
You chose to oppose me!

1628
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,791
Stop these stupid games and come here.

1629
02:23:48,375 --> 02:23:49,833
Otherwise, I will slit your throat.

1630
02:23:49,833 --> 02:23:51,458
Don’t turn around Gopi.

1631
02:24:10,958 --> 02:24:11,875
Gopi!

1632
02:24:13,833 --> 02:24:14,708
Take this.

1633
02:24:14,750 --> 02:24:16,791
Gopi! Take this and go.

1634
02:24:17,333 --> 02:24:18,500
I will be fine.

1635
02:24:19,333 --> 02:24:20,750
Go and do as Peer Baba instructed us.

1636
02:24:20,791 --> 02:24:22,416
My leg is stuck. That’s all.

1637
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:23,666
Go ahead, Gopi.

1638
02:24:53,791 --> 02:24:55,875
Salman, take them and leave.

1639
02:24:56,291 --> 02:24:57,250
What about you?

1640
02:24:57,250 --> 02:24:58,333
You leave first.

1641
02:24:58,500 --> 02:24:59,500
I’ll come

1642
02:25:07,458 --> 02:25:08,500
Nazia…

1643
02:25:14,625 --> 02:25:15,625
Nazia?

1644
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:34,000
Nazia!

1645
02:25:50,833 --> 02:25:51,875
Gopi…

1646
02:26:51,750 --> 02:26:52,916
Come, come. Let’s go.

1647
02:29:31,666 --> 02:29:32,708
Nazia…

1648
02:29:34,583 --> 02:29:35,458
Nazia…

1649
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:36,708
Nazia!

1650
02:29:43,541 --> 02:29:44,500
Nazia!

1651
02:29:53,250 --> 02:29:54,291
Nazia…

1652
02:29:55,541 --> 02:29:57,125
Look here! You'll be alright.

1653
02:29:57,666 --> 02:29:58,750
It’s over.

1654
02:30:08,333 --> 02:30:09,333
Gopi!

1655
02:30:10,416 --> 02:30:11,333
Gopi!

1656
02:30:12,791 --> 02:30:13,833
Is everything okay?

1657
02:30:14,583 --> 02:30:15,541
Gopi!

1658
02:30:15,666 --> 02:30:16,708
Gopi!

1659
02:30:16,833 --> 02:30:17,916
Okay?

1660
02:30:19,916 --> 02:30:20,791
Gopi!

1661
02:30:22,333 --> 02:30:23,666
Don’t act like a kid.

1662
02:30:23,833 --> 02:30:25,416
All this for a small stick?

1663
02:30:26,833 --> 02:30:28,500
It didn’t even go deep.

1664
02:30:29,375 --> 02:30:31,916
I never saw someone shiver
for a couple of sutures.

1665
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,666
Try not to panic.

1666
02:30:33,666 --> 02:30:34,666
Have patience.

1667
02:30:35,583 --> 02:30:36,791
Be positive.

1668
02:30:46,375 --> 02:30:48,708
Before I leave…
I owe you an apology.

1669
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:54,791
Forgive me for saying this job will happen
only if there are two male relatives.

1670
02:30:55,666 --> 02:30:58,333
I underestimated both of you.

1671
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:03,375
I never thought Gopi will come this far.

1672
02:31:06,666 --> 02:31:09,958
I never believed you would be
able to manage this all alone.

1673
02:31:11,833 --> 02:31:17,291
Both of you had a strong resolve
to save Nazia.

1674
02:31:18,291 --> 02:31:23,958
This is the only quality required
to face any sort of difficulty.

1675
02:31:43,583 --> 02:31:45,125
What a crazy man Gopi is

1676
02:31:46,125 --> 02:31:47,041
Hey!

1677
02:31:47,333 --> 02:31:48,666
Why do you say that?

1678
02:31:48,833 --> 02:31:49,833
Then?

1679
02:31:50,166 --> 02:31:52,833
Who would risk so much for strangers?

1680
02:31:56,500 --> 02:31:57,666
Alauddin!

1681
02:32:00,250 --> 02:32:02,750
Isn’t that how humans are supposed to be?

1682
02:32:02,916 --> 02:32:05,416
What is so complicated to understand?

1683
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,791
If possible, help those in need.

1684
02:32:10,291 --> 02:32:13,458
Whether they are family or relations
is not the question.

1685
02:32:14,666 --> 02:32:15,625
People…

1686
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,750
Every one of them has some problem.

1687
02:32:20,916 --> 02:32:22,000
for instance here…

1688
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:24,750
show me one person without a problem.

1689
02:32:28,583 --> 02:32:30,500
Gopi realized this.

1690
02:32:30,791 --> 02:32:32,291
And he helped them out.

1691
02:32:37,958 --> 02:32:42,541
Actually, that’s what you did too.

1692
02:32:48,333 --> 02:32:51,875
But, Baba, I hope he won’t have to face
any danger in future?

1693
02:32:53,833 --> 02:32:56,000
Danger?
Why would that happen?

1694
02:32:56,458 --> 02:32:58,291
Because he dug up the past.

1695
02:32:58,833 --> 02:32:59,958
You told me once.

1696
02:33:00,625 --> 02:33:04,500
Once you bring back the past,
don’t expect things to be normal.

1697
02:33:16,708 --> 02:33:18,291
Been a while since I ate so much.

1698
02:33:20,166 --> 02:33:21,625
I’ll pack you some.

1699
02:33:21,625 --> 02:33:22,666
No, no. It’s okay.

1700
02:33:22,833 --> 02:33:23,791
Come on.

1701
02:33:23,833 --> 02:33:26,833
Who knows when you will come again
and when I can cook for you?

1702
02:33:30,791 --> 02:33:32,791
What are they teaching in your new Art class?

1703
02:33:41,291 --> 02:33:42,958
-This’s good!
-Thanks!

1704
02:33:46,250 --> 02:33:48,625
-How is Nazia now?
-She is fine.

1705
02:33:48,791 --> 02:33:51,500
Did the police not arrest
for Gulfam’s death?

1706
02:33:52,333 --> 02:33:53,500
Sixteen year old girl!

1707
02:33:54,375 --> 02:33:57,500
Who would believe she hung a strong,
six feet tall man and killed him?

1708
02:34:00,916 --> 02:34:04,500
Why didn't you tell anybody that
Abdul was Meertaj’s son?

1709
02:34:04,541 --> 02:34:07,333
Who would want to know about
someone like him?

1710
02:34:07,541 --> 02:34:08,583
That’s why.

1711
02:34:08,666 --> 02:34:10,875
-No one enquired about him?
-No.

1712
02:34:11,583 --> 02:34:15,458
So, according to you,
this was all done by a ghost.

1713
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:17,458
Of course. Who else?

1714
02:34:18,833 --> 02:34:20,375
What about Masooda Be?

1715
02:34:24,500 --> 02:34:25,666
These bloody cats!

1716
02:34:31,291 --> 02:34:32,875
I don’t know what happened to Masooda Be!

1717
02:34:33,083 --> 02:34:35,750
Peer Baba said there is no need
to become a detective about it

1718
02:34:36,833 --> 02:34:39,833
I was curious but I let it go.

1719
02:34:46,458 --> 02:34:49,000
I somehow am unable to believe
all that you said

1720
02:34:50,291 --> 02:34:51,791
Believe it or not,

1721
02:34:53,250 --> 02:34:54,583
I told you all that I know.

1722
02:34:58,833 --> 02:35:00,000
You want some water?

1723
02:35:03,333 --> 02:35:06,375
-It’s kind of incomplete.
-I know.

1724
02:35:17,708 --> 02:35:18,833
What happened?

1725
02:35:19,583 --> 02:35:20,583
Mini!

1726
02:35:20,916 --> 02:35:22,000
What nonsense?

1727
02:35:22,958 --> 02:35:24,666
You are trying to scare me, aren’t you?

1728
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:28,000
I have seen plenty of this kind.

1729
02:35:30,458 --> 02:35:31,750
I am not a coward like before.

1730
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,416
I have changed a lot.

1731
02:35:35,791 --> 02:35:37,000
I am not so easily scared.

1732
02:35:42,375 --> 02:35:43,333
Hey!

1733
02:35:48,583 --> 02:35:49,500
Mini!

1734
02:35:53,291 --> 02:35:54,333
What?

1735
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:59,666
There is someone in the front room
sitting on the floor with open hair

1736
02:36:01,333 --> 02:36:02,666
Stop it now, Mini.

1737
02:36:04,291 --> 02:36:05,000
Hey!

1738
02:36:08,041 --> 02:36:09,000
You are crying for real?

1739
02:36:09,583 --> 02:36:10,916
I am not joking.

1740
02:36:11,125 --> 02:36:15,416
Some lady is sitting on the floor
in the front room with her hair open.

1741
02:36:16,666 --> 02:36:17,750
Oh, my god!

1742
02:36:18,041 --> 02:36:19,541
I am really scared, Gopi.

1743
02:36:21,708 --> 02:36:23,500
-Let me go and check.
-No, no!

1744
02:36:23,500 --> 02:36:25,500
Close the door.
Don’t leave me alone.

1745
02:36:26,333 --> 02:36:27,291
Wait.

1746
02:36:27,375 --> 02:36:29,333
-Stay right here.
-No, Gopi! Please don’t go!

1747
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:34,291
Nothing will happen, wait

1748
02:36:35,305 --> 02:37:35,524
